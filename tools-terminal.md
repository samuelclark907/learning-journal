## Text Editors

- They're are two kinds of text editors basic and advanced. Basic text editors are bare bones editors that have only the necassary componants. Advanced text editors either come with or have the option to add extensions or other add ons.

- Picking a text editor is only important in that it fits your needs and style.


# Terminal

## The Command Line

- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

-If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .

- ls lets you know what is the file your currently in.



## About Files

- file.exe - an executable file, or program.

- file.txt - a plain text file.

- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
