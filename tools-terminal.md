## Text Editors

- **They're are two kinds of text editors basic and advanced. Basic text editors are bare bones editors that have only the necassary componants. Advanced text editors either come with or have the option to add extensions or other add ons.**

- **Picking a text editor is only important in that it fits your needs and style.**


# **Terminal**

## The Command Line

- **A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. So pretty much like a GUI with some similaritys and some differences.**

- **If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty.**

## Basic Navigation

- **PWD stands for Print Working Directory.**

- **LS lets you know what is the file your currently in.**

- **It's easy to get lost in the terminal. Always make sure your where you want to be.**

## Paths

Absolute | Relative
-----------|-----------
specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory | specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system
You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / ) | They will not begin with a slash



## About Files

- file.exe - an executable file, or program.

- file.txt - a plain text file.

- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

**Everything is a file under Linux**
