## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
- you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.




- `==` - is equal to
- `!-` - is not equal to
- `===` - strict equal
- `!==` - strict not equal
- `>` - greater than
- `<` - less than
- `>=` - greater that or equal to
- `<=` - less than or equal to


## Logical Operator
- logical operators allow you to compare the result of more than on comparison operator.

- `&&` - logical and
- `||` - logical or
- `!` - logical not

## Loops
- loops check a condition. If it returns true it will run again. It will keep running until the condition returns false.
- for - used if you want your code to run a specific number of times. This is the mpst common loop. 
- while - used if you dont have a specific number. Will run until it get a false condition.
- do while - same as while but will always run the statement inside the curly brackets atleast once.

## Loop Counters
- a 'for' loop uses a counter as a condition.
- the condition is made up of three statements.
- initializing - create a varialbe and set it to 0. This variable is commonly called "i".
- var i = 0;
- condition - the loop should continue to run until it hits a specific number.
- i < 10;
- update - every time the loop has run the statement, it adds one to the counter.
- i++

## Looping
- the first timethe loop is run the var i is assigned a value of 0.
- everytime the loop is run the condition is checked. Is the variable less than 10?
-  then the code in the loop is run.
