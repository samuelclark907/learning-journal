# The first learning journal of Sam

**Hello, my name is Sam and I'm a student at Code Fellows. Iv'e been interested in coding for a long time but havn't dived in until now. Since the CV outbreak I've moved back to where I'm from Juneau, AK. I'm very excited to explore my interest from the comfort of my own home.**
